Provide special pricing to wholesale customers in WooCommerce.

== DESCRIPTION ==

WooCommerce Wholesale Prices gives WooCommerce store owners the ability to supply specific users with wholesale pricing for their product range.

We've made entering wholesale prices as simple as it should be:

1. Install & activate the WooCommerce Wholesale Prices plugin
1. Navigate to the product you wish to enter wholesale pricing for
1. If it's a Simple product, you'll find a wholesale price box on the General tab, if it's a Variable product, each variation will have a wholesale price box
1. Change the user role of the customers you wish to grant wholesale access to the new Wholesale Customer role

Some features at a glance:

**SIMPLE WHOLESALE PRICING**

No complex setups, it's simply another built-in user role (just like regular Customers) and another pricing box for the information. The plugin takes care of the rest.

**FLEXIBILITY**

You don't have to set wholesale pricing for all of your products you can do just a sub-set.

You can also quick edit Simple product types for easy management.

**GREAT FOR USERS**

Display of your wholesale prices is automatic once your wholesale customers login to their account. The plugin takes care of the front end display.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `woocommerce-wholesale-prices/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Visit the product you wish to edit and enter the wholesale price
1. Change the customer's user role by going to Users->All Users, clicking edit on the user, and changing their "Role" to the Wholesale Customer role.
